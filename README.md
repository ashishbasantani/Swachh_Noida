# Swachh Noida
India is a country of responsible citizens. Whenever we see garbage littering in open, we want it to get removed. But sometimes even after complaining, it doesn't gets removed. We have developed a website through which people can report to the concerned authorities for the polluted areas in their surrounding by clicking the photos and directly sending it. This app was initially developed for Noida.
